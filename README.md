# Data Science for Medicine and Public Health
**Thu, 29 Mar 2018 (2.30PM - 5.30PM)**<br>
**NUS MD1 Level 8 Computer Lab 1**<br>

Guest Speaker: Asst. Prof. Mengling Feng<br>
NUS School of Public Health, School of Medicine and School of Computing

Facilitator: Dr Calvin J Chiew

## Guest Speaker
**Dr Mengling Feng** is currently an Assistant Professor at National University of Singapore with School of Public Health, School of Medicine and School of Computing. He is also the Senior Assistant Director of National University Hospital championing the big data analytics efforts. Dr Feng is also an affiliated scientist with the Lab of Computational Physiology, Harvard-MIT Health Science Technology Division. His research is to develop effective big data management and analysis methods to extract actionable knowledge to improve the quality of care. His research brings together concepts and tools across machine learning, optimization, signal processing, statistical causal inference and big data management. In particular, he has been publishing on physiological signal forecasting, modeling of disease progress trajectory, dynamic patient phenotyping, statistical understanding of treatment effects and management of heterogenous medical big data.

## Description
Asst. Prof. Mengling Feng from NUS Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Computing, will speak on “Data Science and AI to Improve Our Understanding of Health and Disease”. Following this, I will conduct a workshop aimed at introducing popular statistical methods used in machine learning, without delving into the underlying mathematical theory. We will focus on the random forest and support vector machine for classification, as well as general concepts of model fit and cross-validation. In the hands-on exercise, you will be asked to implement and evaluate these models on a clinical prediction problem. No prior programming experience is assumed. Basics of the Python language and Jupyter notebook environment will be covered. 

## Instructions for Using Personal Laptop
1. Download the installer for Anaconda 5.0.1 (Python 3.6 version) on your respective OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. 
2. Run the installer and use all default options when prompted. 
3. After installation is complete, make sure you can open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter notebook.
